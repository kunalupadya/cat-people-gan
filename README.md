Files used:
peoplegan.ipynb - DCGAN for generating humans or cats
catpeoplegan.ipynb - Custom Dual discriminator gan to create cat/human hybrids.

Need to have a kaggle.json file to download from kaggle cli (instructions here https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api)

Just run either file using a GPU, they were tested on google colab resources
